## Background

Endless runs [game-making learning programs](https://www.endlessos.org/game-making) focused on novice through advanced learners ages 13+. We provide opportunities for career-readiness and collaboration within a community of game makers.

[Candy Wrapper] is an openly-licensed game built with Godot 4.3. Its simple nature and expandable design lead us to choose it as the base for programs where learners collaboratively build and maintain a game, onboarding them to a real community experience. With our fork, _Everlasting Candy_, we respect the original Candy Wrapper design while facilitating community-contributed content and design. We hope to foster a lasting community of open source game developers who can continuously improve and expand upon the game while learning new skills and sharpening existing ones.

## Development

Built with [Godot Engine 4.3](https://godotengine.org)
